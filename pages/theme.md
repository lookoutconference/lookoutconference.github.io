## **Conference Themes and Subthemes**

New directions for fire lookouts, theories of space and place or dwelling, architectural design in off-grid and natural settings, or forest management policy and technology that has augmented or replaced fire lookouts. 

This year’s theme, ***“Lookouts and the Wilderness,”*** focuses on the relationship between lookouts and Wilderness. 

***Fire Lookouts in the Wilderness***  
We are interested in any presentations that examine fire lookouts contained in federally designated Wilderness. These can be active exceptions (think Sheepeater Lookout) or abandoned structures (think Chicken Peak). These can be stories about staffing remote Wilderness lookouts or hiking out and seeing an abandoned lookout. What feelings of wildness do these inspire in you? What does Wilderness mean in the context of lookouts? Should they be allowed in the Wilderness? We are interested in getting into the weeds on this debate! 

***Fire Lookouts Adjacent to Wilderness***  
Some lookouts are placed adjacently to official Wilderness areas and are meant to monitor Wilderness. We are interested in presentations that discuss this role of Wilderness fire "monitoring" and perhaps Wilderenss fire policy as it relates to the space called the "Wildland Urban Interface." 

***Lookouts and Wilderness of the Mind***  
Roderick Fraizer Nash published his seminal Wilderness text *Wilderness and the American Mind* in the 1970s, and since an explosion of Wilderness thought has exploded! Wilderenss is both a physical space and a concept that is born inside of humans. The fire lookout, too, is a place that exists both in physical space and in the human mind. They were built for official purposes--watching over valuable stands of timber and monitoring fire--and yet, when you put a person on a mountain top in a small box with good natural lighting, something else begins to happen. The human mind runs wild, starts writing books, championing the environment, connecting to nature in profound and numerous ways. Lookouts and the Wilderness of the mind is about the internal space of fire lookouts that occurs within the human mind. 

***Lookouts and a Wilderness Quality*** <br>This theme explores how lookouts help maintain a Wilderness quality. Do lookouts somehow enhance the Wilderness experience? Some may argue that the architecture of the lookout is part of the larger architecture of the Wildereness. This session may act as a counter argument to lookout purism which often rejects the lookout structure within Wilderness. These sessions may also discuss how Wilderness has evolved over time, and how new adaptations and ways of viewing Wilderness (one that emphasizes the human architecture of Wilderness) is necessary. 

***Lookouts as Structure and other Wilderness Structures and Networks***
This session is all about the nuts and bolts of lookouts. We want to hear about Wilderness and rural structure building from experts who have constructed or restored lookouts. We are also interested in hearing about the network that lookouts are a part of. This can include ranger stations, dispatch networks, fire crews, or pilots. The lookout structure and its network is an impressive act that takes tremendous technical knoledge and a unified theory of cooperation. This session can include how lookouts are built, preserved, how they interact with other structures, or how they exist in a broader communication network.
