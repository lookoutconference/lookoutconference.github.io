# **PARTICIPATE**

There are a number of ways you can participate in NILC 2025\.

**1\) Present at NILC**

Project or Short Paper:   
15-20 minute presentation

In the spirit of interdisciplinarity, we welcome submissions from a broad range of disciplines, including natural resources professionals, fire managers, current and former fire lookouts, GIS experts, humanities scholars, architects, and civil engineers related to the theme *“The Past and Future of Fire Lookouts.”* Project, do not need to be specifically related to fire lookouts. A broad range of technologies have either augmented or replaced fire lookouts, and we are excited to host presentations on any of the above areas of research. 

We encourage papers and presentations from both academic and non-academic fields. In addition to the disciplines above, we recognize that great work is being done outside of these spaces. We welcome passion projects, which are often the heartbeat of the fire lookout community. This includes projects to preserve fire lookouts through photo or video collections, public media projects (such as podcasts), and restoration / preservation work of all kinds!


*Papers* delve into more comprehensive investigations, emphasizing complete versions of ideas or developed research. \- A paper abstract is at most 500 words, excluding references, and may include up to five images. 

*Projects* introduce first versions, photo or video essays / documentation, or initial research, public-facing media, and more. \- A project abstract is at most 350 words, excluding references, and may include a maximum of ten images.

*Abstracts should include the following:*

* Introduce your research or ideas.

* Explain how your work relates to fire lookouts, either directly or indirectly.

* Specify whether your research focuses on the history, future, or both of these aspects of fire lookouts.

* Highlight the innovative elements of your work, particularly if it envisions new directions for fire lookouts, theories of space and place or dwelling, architectural design in off-grid and natural settings, or forest management policy which may include forestry, GIS, environmental science, natural resource conservation and more!
* We will publish a proceedings index to offer free access to NILC presentation and papers. Please contact NILC to reuse any material found in the conference proceedings index.
