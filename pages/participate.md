# **PARTICIPATE**

There are a number of ways you can participate in NILC 2026.

### 1. Present at NILC: Lookouts and the Wilderness

We invite submissions for presentations that discuss the complex relationship between **Wilderness** and fire lookouts.

* **The Core Paradox:** Fire lookouts are inseparable from the concept of the wild. However, Wilderness is officially defined as a place where “man is but a visitor who does not remain.” This creates a fascinating paradox, as Wilderness lookouts *do* remain, and lookouts outside of Wilderness gaze permanently upon Wilderness landscapes, providing an experience often seen as "wild."
* **Broadening the Scope of Wilderness:** We welcome presentations defining Wilderness in broad terms:
    * Official, federally designated **“Capital W” Wilderness**.
    * A landscape with a general **wild character**.
    * Wildness within urban landscapes, the human mind, or other non-traditional spaces.
* **Related Structures:** We are also interested in the fire lookout's relationship to other wilderness structures, such as Ranger Stations or private inholdings.

### **Submission Guidelines**

We encourage papers and presentations from both **academic and non-academic fields**. In addition to traditional disciplines, we recognize and welcome **passion projects**, which are the heartbeat of the fire lookout community. This includes projects focused on:

* Preservation through photo or video collections.
* Public media projects (such as podcasts).
* Restoration and preservation work of all kinds.

#### **Instructions for Submission:**

Write a proposal of **no more than 500 words** covering the following three points:

1.  **An Overview:** A clear summary of your proposed presentation or project.
2.  **Relevance to the Theme:** Explain how your proposal relates to the conference topic, “Lookouts and the Wilderness.”
3.  **Presentation Length:** Indicate how long you intend to present. We are open to accommodating:
    * **Longer sessions** (45 minutes, with 10 minutes for questions).
    * **Shorter presentations** (10–15 minutes, typically in a panel format).

The conference offers a **limited number of remote presentations (Zoom)**. Those interested in participating in this mode can contact the conference organizers through the following form: <a href="https://futurevandals.uidaho.edu/register/?id=c6162e10-cb08-4c3e-83fd-08a7fe968943">Contact form</a>
