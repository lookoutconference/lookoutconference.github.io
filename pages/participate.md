# **PARTICIPATE**

There are a number of ways you can participate in NILC 2026.

**1) Present at NILC**

Fire towers are inseperable from the concept of the Wilderness. How do we understand this relationship? Wilderness is defined as a place where "man is but a visitor who does not remain," and yet, Wilderness lookouts remain. Lookouts outside of Wilderness gaze permently upon Wilderness landscapes. And even those lookouts not within, or adjacent to, Wilderness, well they still have a wilderness character. They provide an experience that is often seen as "wild." 

We are interested in presentations that discuss Wilderness and fire lookouts. Wilderness can be defined as either official "Capital W" Wilderness, or a landscape that has a wild character. It can also refer to wildness within urban landscapes, inside one's mind, or in other non-traditionl Wilderness spaces. Other presentations can be about the fire lookouts relationship to other Wilderness structures like Ranger stations or private inholdings. 

We encourage papers and presentations from both academic and non-academic fields. In addition to the disciplines above, we recognize that great work is being done outside of these spaces. We welcome passion projects, which are often the heartbeat of the fire lookout community. This includes projects to preserve fire lookouts through photo or video collections, public media projects (such as podcasts), and restoration / preservation work of all kinds!

Instructions for submissions are as follows: 

Write no more than 500 words covering the following: 

1) An overview of your proposed presentation
2) How it relates to the conferfence topic
3) How long you intend to present--we are open to accomodating longer sessions (45 minutes with 10 minutes for questions) or shorter presentations (10-15 minutes in panel formats).
