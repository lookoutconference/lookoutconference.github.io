## **About the Conference/Theme**

The National Interdisciplinary Lookout Conference (NILC) invites abstracts and proposals for its second annual conference. This year’s theme, *“Lookouts and the Wilderness,”* explores the fire lookout and Wilderness as mutual concept, how they are connected and relate to one another, and the mutual infrastructures and relationships that they create in humans and human institutions.

In the spirit of interdisciplinarity, we welcome submissions from a broad range of disciplines, including hobbyists/enthusiasts, active or former fire lookouts, natural resources professionals, fire managers, GIS experts, humanities scholars, architects, and civil engineers. 

The conference will take place April 19, 2025, at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. Once home to more active fire lookouts than any other state—and therefore the world—Idaho is a fitting location for NILC ‘26. Our aim is to bring together different perspectives and disciplines to shape the future of fire lookout towers, which remain integral to fire management policies in Idaho and across the American West.  

**A full conference schedule will be posted in late-March once presentation submissions are finalized.**
