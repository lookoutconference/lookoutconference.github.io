This fourth-year architecture project redef ines the lookout typology by altering “lookout” as an action in three steps, tracing its effects on structure and occupant. Step one studies “looking out” from a fixed point, using the late Stormy Peak Lookout Tower in the Salmon National Forest for historical and topographic context. Step two explores “looking in,” initiating deconstruction and memorialization through a visitor-centered compound. Step three considers “looking between,” separating programmatic elements into single-use cabins. Through this staged deconstruction, the Stormy Peak Lookout ultimately transcends the typology, helping redefine its architectural boundaries.",stormy peak lookout; typology; architecture; improvement; innovation; integration; utilitarianism; salmon national forest,University of Idaho Integrated Research and Innovation Center,image; moving image,video/mp4,eng,
